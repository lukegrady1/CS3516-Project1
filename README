To start please open your terminal and go to the proper directory.  Then please run the command "make".

To run the client, run this command in the terminal:
./http_client [-p] IP/URL PORT_NUMBER

The p is in [] because it is optional, it will print out the RTT after the GET request has been made.  IP/URL can be from any website of your choice, for example, www.google.com or www.example.com.  Make the port number always 80.

To run the server, run this command in a new terminal in the same directory and run this command:
./http_server PORT_NUMBER

The only thing needed for this command is to make up a port number that the server and client will use to communicate with eachother.  For example, 
./http_server 7890
Once the server is running you can then go back to the client and run the command from the client side and see the server and client communicating.

For example, I used the command: 
./http_client -p linux.wpi.edu/TMDG.html 7890 
* I did this after running the server command with the specified port number being 7890
